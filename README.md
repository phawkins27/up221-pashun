# up221-pashun: Data Science Project
### Winter 2024 
My is Pa-Shun Hawkins, and I am a first year phD student in the Institute in Environment and Sustainability, and I have a background in marine and Environmental Scienece. 
As of now, I think my project will focus on using navigate GIS, and use to portray the proximity of CAFOS (Concentrated animal feeding operation) and low income individuals in the United States. Throughout this course I hope to strengthen my coding skills and navigate GIS.
